    Pressing these buttons will open a new tab that navigates to Twitter and scrolls through your liked or bookmarked
    tweets to index them.
  </p>

  <div>
    <button id="index-likes" style="display: block;">Index Likes</button>
    <button id="index-bookmarks" style="display: block; margin-top: 8px;">Index Bookmarks</button>
  </div>

  <p>
    YOU MUST KEEP THIS TAB OPEN AND ACTIVE UNTIL INDEXING IS COMPLETE.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can open a new Chrome window, but you cannot switch to another tab in this Chrome window, or you will interrupt
    indexing and may need to start over from the beginning.
